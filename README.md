# PhpStorm Reset Trial

**Update of 06/11/2019:** The initial idea of creating this utility was not piracy, but the ability to use PhpStorm without the need for constant access to the Internet, so that you can work on a laptop far away from home without the Internet. A few days ago, a JetBrains representative contacted me and told me that now there is an opportunity to activate PhpStorm via an offline activation code, in which case Internet access is not required. To do this, just [go to your account](https://account.jetbrains.com/) and open the “Download activation code for offline usage”. I tried and I did it. Therefore, I see no reason to develop and continue to use this utility. In addition, the representative asked me to voluntarily remove information describing the technology of hacking their software, citing the DMCA policy of GitHub. I had to go for it, because otherwise the repository would be deleted through filing a complaint.
